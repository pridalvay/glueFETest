# Observations
1. On the Number keypad, "."  is disabled from typing into the age feild but negative value is allowed. This senario is not handled. 
Hence the frontend displays the HTTP 500 error as it is.
2. "AM I OLD ENOUGHT TO DRINK?" button has typo in the text.
3. "AM I OLD ENOUGHT TO DRINK?" button doesnt change states when value is entered.
4. App crashes if the "AM I OLD ENOUGHT TO DRINK?" button is tapped when Age feild is empty or when it has just "-".
